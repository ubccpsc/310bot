# CPSC 310 2021W1 Discord ‚ä• (`\bot`)

Known as `@\bot` in our Discord server.

All PRs merged to main go live instantly!
So if you'd like a new bot feature in this discord, add it yourself :eyes:

## Features

### Commands
In all examples below, the prefix has been set to `$`

#### `$help <commandName>?`
Displays the list of commands.
Optionally adding a command name
will make the bot respond with details about the named command.

Example:
```
$help prefix
```

#### `$prefix <newPrefix>`
Updates the prefix which bot will listen to for executing commands.

This prefix should be a single, non-alphanumeric character,
and it should not be one of `@`, `/`, or `#`.

Example:
```
$prefix !
!help
```

### Other
- **Mention**: Mentioning the bot in a message to a server channel will have it reply to you with usage instructions

- Modify as necessary to your environment.

### Scripts

### API
To create a Listener or Command:
1. Create a file in either the [`src/listeners`](./src/listeners) or [`src/commands`](./src/commands) directory
2. Import the type `Listener` or `Command` from `"@ubccpsc310/bot-base"`
3. Create a `default export` which is of type `Listener` or `Command`

Additionally, available to you is the function `getDatabase()` which provides an object for storing arbitrary JSON in arbitrary tables.

More information is found in the `bot-base` documentation.
